# modules

a way to import/export code from project to project, done messy before, looking to streamline and improve...

1. check the package for contents, assets, etc...
2. assemble the setup notes/instructions in the readme...
3. zip/date when it's good... drag n drop it...
4. test and refine it, keep a modules port directory in other projects ongoing
